# VR-DoggyRoom
My experience prototype for a vr game for user research. I tested it on my target users who will be similar to the profiles of those attending the Exhibition to see how they react and what impact this experience would have on them while using it. The game has core elements of the final prototype--a small maze with rooms and visuals on the wall.
